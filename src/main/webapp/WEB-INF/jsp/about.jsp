		<p> Imagine this: you’ve had a long day at work, and while you're on your way home, you realize 
		that you forgot to research the restaurant you’re going to take your partner 
		for date night. <br><br>
		Or this: it's time for your first meal in a new city. You're starving from the long trip there, and 
		you're in the mood for something specific. Where do you start to look for a place to 
		grab a quick bite?
		<br><br>
		If only there was an application that could quickly whip up nearby restaurant matches 
		for you...</p>
<h5 class="aboutaccent"><br><i class="fa fa-cutlery aboutaccent" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;Say hello to Restaurant Tinder!</h5><br>

<p>RT was founded in 2019 in Cleveland, Ohio at <a class="detailslink" href="https://www.techelevator.com/" target="_blank">Tech Elevator</a>. 
You tell us what you’d like to eat, along with where and how much you’d like to spend, 
and we generate options for you - one restaurant at a time. <br><br>

With each recommendation, you tell us whether you'd like to see that particular option again or not.
Your feedback allows us to cater to your individual preferences within the search.<br><br>

We encourage a social aspect, so please leave a review and rating 
of your experience with each restaurant. Your opinion really matters, and your feedback
helps us make better suggestions for all the users of our application. After all, we're all in this together! <i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i><br><br>

Lastly, don't forget to go directly to the <a class="detailslink" href="favorites">Favorites</a> page if you want to see all the matches that you liked before. 
Restaurant Tinder strives to make each of your meals as pleasurable and effortless as possible - as any great match
should be.</p>
